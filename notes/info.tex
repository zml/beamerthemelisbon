Example:
$P\neq NP ?$

\begin{align*}
10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010\\
00011101001000101101001000101111010100000100111101
\end{align*}
Yet, by the immutable laws of probability, each string has an equal chance ($2^{-50}$) in being chosen at random from all sequences of 50 binary digit
