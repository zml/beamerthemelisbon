## Installation

1. Install LaTeX.
2. Clone the git repository from github `git clone https://github.com/zml/beamerthemelisbon.git`.
3. run `make` to compile the file `main.tex` in *handout* mode or `make MODE=present` to compile with presenter's notes and slide breaks.
4. If you like the theme, simply copy the files
`colors.sty`,
`beamercolorthemeLisbon.sty` and
`beamerthemeLisbon.sty` to a path where LaTeX is looking for additional code,
such as `~/texmf`.
